# LoliBot - The ESP32 Based Soccer bot.

Welcome to the 2018 linux.conf.au Open Hardware Project.  You can see information about this and other MiniConfs at http://www.openhardwareconf.org/wiki/Main_Page

This simple robot is designed to chase and kick a Ping Pong ball around.  The Lolin32-lite package by Wemos has been used to get the most out of the ESP32 chip.
