# LoliBot - The ESP32 Based Soccer bot.

Welcome to the 2018 linux.conf.au Open Hardware Project.  You can see information about this and other MiniConfs at http://www.openhardwareconf.org/wiki/Main_Page

This simple robot is designed to chase and kick a Ping Pong ball around.  It features a Lolin32-lite ESP32 based chip as it's primary microprocessor and includes a MPU6050 6 axis accelerometer.

In order to reduce complexity and to be a bit more flexible with our design this years project is a platform with discrete components.
Those of you who are looking forward to the smell of melting solder won't be disappointed though, there are many headers, LEDS and switches to keep you busy.
